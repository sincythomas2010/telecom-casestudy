Problem Statement: Consider a telecom service provider has the dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months â€” June, July, August and September. The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months and hence to mitigate the issue of churn by mapping the same to different customer behaviors during good and actions phases.

Out aim is to build a model to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc. The model will also be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

Following steps have been taken to prepare the model:

Data Cleaning Filtering the high-value customers Tagging churn and non-churn customers Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering & Data Visualization Data Preparation Model building (I): Churn prediction Model building (II): Important Feature Identification Actionable recommendations
